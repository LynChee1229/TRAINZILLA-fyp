## Project Objectives

 - **To provide users with the necessary information and help them avoid any delays by suggesting better train routes.**

    *<small>This system provides users with multiple suggested routes based on their departure station and arrival station. It also provides users with the nearest departure time and estimated time taken of each suggested route. Moreover, users can get the latest announcements about stations and trains on the website, such as train delays or temporary closures of stations.</small>*
    
<br>
    
 - **To reduce the inconvenience for users to take the train.**

    *This system can oversimplify the complicated real-world train system, which is beneficial to passengers and travelers. Users can access the ticketing system online anytime, anywhere, and purchase tickets directly, which saves time, cost, and efficiency. Furthermore, it provides detailed and easy-to-understand map information and timetables for users, which can be downloaded to local devices and viewed offline.*

<br>
    
 - **To encourage people to use trains as their priority of transportation.**

    *Traveling by train is more environmentally friendly, thus to encourage people to use trains, Trainzilla provides users with reward points for every
transaction. Users can redeem points to obtain discount vouchers that can be applied for their next ticket purchase. In addition, all vouchers have no expiration date and can be redeemed unlimited times.*
